# Welcome to Career Change Motivation

### View the app [here](https://careermotivation.onrender.com).

This application was created to motivate career changers to tech to keep going through the difficult parts of learning and interviewing. 

Bearing in mind that money isn't the only motivator, the second page features career changer stories. This will eventually be optimized with a search function.

Anyone who has started their career outside of tech and transitioned into a career in tech is invited to contribute.

--Built with Node.js, Express, Bootstrap and EJS.

Feel free to reach out if you have suggestions or other comments.

If you are currently considering a career in tech and don't know where to start, check out [100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/).


Collaborators: These folx helped with logic and code along the way, thanks a bunch! @Rascal_Two @Gratcan @Screwage @chrissiecodes


## Development

### Install dependencies

Install the dependencies:

    npm install


### Running MongoDB locally

Copy the example `.env` file:

    cp .env.example .env

The example file is checked into Git and is not sensitive. This is meant to work with MongoDB locally and not in production.

Open Docker Desktop

    docker-compose up -d

You can also run the following script which has been added for convenience:

    npm run mongo

In the future, you can go into Docker Desktop and press the play button for the relevant container.
